## Services

### Snapshot

We capture a daily snapshot for each node, and to optimize file server space, we routinely remove previous snapshots.
These snapshots are tailored for node operators aiming to efficiently run a validator service on various chains like
Evmos, Celestia, Composable, Chihuahua, Chain 4 Energy, Nomic, Osmosis, Persistence, and Source Protocol.

To ensure optimal disk space utilization, we employ specific settings to minimize the snapshot size while maintaining
its viability for validator operations. It's recommended to implement similar adjustments on your node. However,
be aware that these optimizations may limit certain functionalities of your node, such as serving as an RPC endpoint.
This limitation is intentional, as running an RPC endpoint on a validator node is not advisable.

### Address Book

Address books play a crucial role in decentralized networks, serving as essential configurations for nodes.
They enable nodes to efficiently locate and communicate with each other across the network. In the context of
blockchain platforms like Evmos, Celestia, Composable, Chihuahua, Chain 4 Energy, Nomic, Osmosis, Persistence,
and Source Protocol, the address book configuration is instrumental for establishing connections between nodes.

For each of these networks, the address book configuration is dynamically fetched using a specific command, as
illustrated in the provided examples. This retrieval process ensures that nodes have updated and accurate information
about the network's peers, facilitating seamless communication and collaboration. Address books are integral components
in the infrastructure of decentralized systems, contributing to the overall resilience and efficiency of blockchain networks.
